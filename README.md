### Welcome to the VA Maximal JSON Page Grouper

What is it? 
- This utility can be used to visualize the maximal-test.json from the vets-website repo.
- From there, you can check to see how many pages/views are being used in the payload, what their values are, and inspect at a page level for values against the root key.
- This is useful when having to do manual auditing of individual cypress and web components inside of the vets-website repository.
